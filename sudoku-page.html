    <h2 class="title">Constraint-Solving to Solve Sudoku Puzzles</h2>
    <p>
      A popular Japanese puzzle game, Sudoku, is a simple, yet complex game.
      The whole goal is to fill all the squares with the numbers 1-9 such that there are no repeated numbers in each row, column, or subsquare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course we can't just guess every permutation of a sudoku grid until we get a solution that's correct.
      There are 81 squares in total (9 x 9) and 9 possibilities for each square (numbers 1-9).
      In the worst possible case, we have 9^81 possible grids and that's quite a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, some squares are already filled with numbers, so we can use our constraints (no number can repeat in a row, column, and subsquare), to grealty reduce the number of possibiblities.
      And that's exactly what our AI does, it eliminates solutions it knows is incorrect until a square only has only 1 possible solution.
      From here, the AI can further constrain the problem.
      However, at some point, there are no squares left with only 1 possible choice.
      So, we're forced to guess; we just have to keep track of our guesses and pick the other choice when we find out that this guess can't lead to a correct solution.
