    <p>
      Gomoku is a Japanese puzzle game similar to Go.
      The objective of Gomoku is to put five of your pieces in a line (horizontally, veritcally, or diagonally) before your opponent can.

    <p>
      To play this game, I use Monte Carlo Tree Search to find the best move.
      The basic idea is to look at all the possible places to put down a piece and simulate a game from there on several times and the win ratio for each move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since there are so many possible moves, the time it takes to run all these simulations can get very expensive, so we limit the number of simulations.
      Despite this, our AI still works very well.
