  <h1>2048 AI</h1>
  <h2 class="title">Alpha-Beta Pruning to Play 2048</h2>
    <p>
      2048 is a popular puzzle game, in which the objective is to obtain the 2048 tile.
      One can get higher tiles by combining two tiles of the same value.
      The difficulty lies in simple mechanics of the game.
      You can only swipe in 4 directions; each swipe causes all the tiles to move in that direction in the 4 by 4 grid and causes a 2 tile randomly appear in an empty square.
      When you run out of moves, you lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, most people can get to a pretty high valued tile by looking 1 step ahead.
      One can see that by swiping in one direction they can double the value of a tile.
      However, it takes more than this to reach the 2048 tile.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the AI used here looks only 1 step ahead, it appears as though it is just moving tiles around randomly.
      The advantage this AI has over humans is that it can actually simulate several moves ahead and see which move will lead to a higher score. 
      Here the AI takes its current state and branches out, creating states for the resulting state if they did each of the 4 possible moves.
      Then, from each of these states, the AI can branch out again and again, looking further into the future.
      However, it's clear to see that the tree the AI is building can grow exceptionally fast and take up far too many resources.
      So it's best to restrict the AI from looking too many moves ahead to avoid waiting a long time for it to make a move.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, despite this improvement, we still can't achieve the 2048 tile.
      To do this, we're going to implement a common strategy people use: putting the higher valued tiles in a corner; this keeps the tiles neatly organized and will allow us to put them together easily.
      We can implement this in our AI in the form of a heuristic.
      We simply weight the squares in the upper left corner so that our AI will evaluate the score to be higher when the tiles are there, and will thus be encouraged to pick moves that keep those pieces there.
