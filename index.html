      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <img src="./face.jpg">
      <p>
        My name is James Cor and I am a second year student majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego.
        Currently, I am working towards a Bachlors of Science in Computer Science, but I intend to pursue a Masters of Science in Computer Science, specifically for Artificial Intelligence.

      <h3>Past Projects</h3>
      <p>
        These are some of my favorite projects over the past two years of studying Computer Science..
      </p>
      <h4>2048 Solver</h4>
      <p>
        This is an AI capable of solving a modified version of the popular 2048 game.
        Implemented in Python, specifically the pygame library, this game is 
      </p>
      
      <h4>Gomoku AI</h4>
      <p>
        This uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to play several games ahead and see what moves leadto a victory.
        
      </p>
      <h4>Blackjack AI</h4>
      <p>
        This is a program does two things: evaluate a policy and try to create its own policy.
        So a policy is simply a rule that an AI follows.
        Here, our rule is "hit when under 17".
        Using Monte Carlo Tree Policy Evaluation we can see that this policy actually does pretty well, it wins about 40% of the time.
        We use a strategy called Q-learning to create our own strategy.
        This strategy works quite a bit better, but only leads us to just above 50% win rate.
        As a result, it's not very beneficial to play Blackjack, especially for a prolonged period of time, as it is unlikely you'll come out on top.
      </p>
      <h4>Sudoku Solver</h4>
      <p>
        Many small puzzle games we are NP-Complete, which basically means we don't have a really good algorithm to solve them.
        However, this doesn't mean we can't; people can solve sudoku puzzles really quickly. 
        Here, I've written a sudoku solver using constraint solving and backtracking.
        There are x many permutations of a sudoku board, which are far too many solutions to search through to solve our problem.
        The idea of constraint solving is that we can use given information to drastically reduce the number of possible solutions we should search through.
        The idea of backtracking is that we recursively try or guesses, and we are able to know which decisions lead to wrong answers.
        There is an improvement to this, which is using a SAT solver.
        Sudoku is essentially a series of conditions that we need to satisfy to find an answer.
        When we do a series of movies that lead to a wrong answer, we can create a new condition that is essentially another constraint and urther reduce the number of poential solutions to try.
      </p>
      <h4>Roommate Engagement Needs Tool (RENT)</h4>
      <p>
        This is an app I worked on with a group of 9 other UCSD students for our CSE 110 class.
        RENT works to help roommate coordinate with one another.
        The app contains several features, such as an expenses tracker, a calendar, and a bulletin board.
        The expenses tracker allows roommates to coordinate payments to the 
      </p>
      <p>
        I intend to show my very first project here at UCSD during a summer program, Summer Program for Incoming Students (SPIS); a Raspberry Pi based robot that is capable of drawing recursive shapes.
        I plan to talk about an app, R.E.N.T, I worked on in CSE 110, and discuss my experience of working in a team with new technologies.
        I can include my final project for COGS 108, which is a Data Science projects (using jupyter notebooks); the project explores and answers questions about parking meters and their effect on traffic.
        Additionally, I have worked with Professor Paul Cao in his CSE 198 class to create Data Science projects intended to teach high schoolers about data aggregation and analysis.
        Here, I can discuss my thought process behind collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data. I will also showcase projects from my CSE 150 class; these include: An efficient path finder, a 2048 AI, a Gomoku AI, a BlackJack AI, and a Sudoku solver.
